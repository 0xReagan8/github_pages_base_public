        Our story follows You, the reader, as you navigate a hellish Academy created by Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder of cryptocurrency. Throughout his cruel educational system, Nakamoto has created the ultimate tool for extracting the highest amount of financial value out of his psychopathic students! For unknown reasons, he has admitted you as the first male student to the Academy. Soon after you arrive, you become the lustful eye of the most psychotic girls in school- who would literally kill to be with you! 
        Underneath its B-Horror lens lies a critique of the NFT culture, its nihilistic greed, and the rampant problems of infighting and community exploitation within the current space. Our team wanted to tell  a story embedded with a time capsule of the world's behavior and interests in 2022, to create something with both style and substance.
